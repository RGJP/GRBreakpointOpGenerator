Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator

This is the PowerShell (WINDOWS OS) 'Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator', aimed mostly at MILSIMs who would like to have the ability to generate infinite, random operations. It also helps to stimulate creativity / what to do in-game.

Included within the files is a list of all locations per province. (Main bases and locations, if anything major is missing, let me know).
*The list excludes little sites like Skell Technology Location, Abandoned Site, Drone patrols, Caves, etc.
Since they are smaller and of lesser interest, you're welcome to add these little spots in the operation yourself after it's generated, if you so desire.

HOW IT WORKS:

Download the files and extract to a folder. Then start 'GR-BREAKPOINT-OPERATION-GENERATOR.ps1' (Right-click, Run with PowerShell).
You will then be asked :

1-Choose one or more province as the AO (from the GridView that appears).
2-Number of locations desired? (The number of locations you want included in the generated operation)

A random roll is then offered, if satisfied with it you say 'y' and it then creates a basic operation template based on selections.

Enjoy!

P.S.: The code is basic, it's all there for anyone to improve upon. I'm not really gonna manage this and act on suggestions unless it's locations missing I can add to the files. Anyone is free to do anything they wish with it, I made this mostly for my own group but chose to make it public so the GR community can benefit as I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy this generator.
