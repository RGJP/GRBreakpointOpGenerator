Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator

This is the PowerShell (WINDOWS OS) 'Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator', aimed mostly at MILSIMS but suitable for any player who would like to have the ability to generate infinite, truly randomized operations. It also helps to stimulate creativity / generate a unique mission to do in the game.

Included within the files is a list of all major locations per province. (Main bases and locations, if anything major is missing, let me know).

*The list excludes little sites like Skell Technology Location, Abandoned Site, Drone patrols, Caves, etc.
Since these are smaller/optional and of lesser interest, you're welcome to add these little spots to the operation after it's generated, if you so desire.

HOW IT WORKS:

Download https://github.com/RGJP/GRBreakpointOpGenerator/raw/main/GR-BREAKPOINT-OPERATION-GENERATOR.zip and extract to a folder, then start 'GR-BREAKPOINT-OPERATION-GENERATOR.ps1' (Right-click, Run with PowerShell).

You will then be asked :

1-Choose one or more province as the AO (from the GridView that appears, CTRL+Click to select more than one), ex.:

2-Number of locations desired? (The number of locations you want included in the generated operation), ex.:

A random roll is then offered, if satisfied with it you say 'y' and it then creates a basic operation template based on selections.

Pretty cool huh :) ? Enjoy running your unique operation! 

The code is as basic as possible to keep it simple, it's all there for anyone to improve upon. I'm willing to improve it a bit based on suggestions but I won't make this a full blown project. Anyone is free to do anything they wish with it (would be pretty cool if someone could pick this up and make it an online tool, I don't have the time to commit to that and host it, etc.) I made this mostly for my own group and chose to make it public so the Ghost Recon Breakpoint community can benefit from it as I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy this generator.

Feel free to tell me if you have any comments or if any major base/location is missing from the files.

Files are clean if you're worried (also you can check the code, it's simple): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5111da58b19d2c1c0f1a49e0a987363e284c3106b6334690fc3df1d14feaebc9?nocache=1
