Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator

This is the PowerShell (WINDOWS OS) 'Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Operation Generator', aimed mostly at MILSIMs who would like to have the ability to generate infinite, random operations. It also helps to stimulate creativity / what to do in-game.

Included within the files is a list of all locations per province. (Main bases / locations, if anything major is missing, let me know).
*The list excludes little sites like Skell Technology Location, Abandoned Site, Drone patrols, Caves, etc.
Since they are smaller and of lesser interest, you're welcome to add these little spots in the operation yourself after it's generated, if you so desire.

HOW IT WORKS:

Download the files and extract to a folder. Then start 'GR-BREAKPOINT-OPERATION-GENERATOR.ps1' (Right-click, Run with PowerShell).
You will then be asked :

1-You pick one or more province as the Area of Operations (AO).
2-You specify the number of locations you want to have in the operation.

An random roll is then offered, if satisfied with it you say 'y' and it then creates an operation template.
